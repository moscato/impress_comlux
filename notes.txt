LIGHTING!!

        // Add better lighting
        const ambientLight = new THREE.AmbientLight(0xffffff, 10);
        scene.add(ambientLight);

        // Directional light from the front
        const directionalLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 10);
        directionalLight.position.set(1, 1, 1);
        scene.add(directionalLight);

        // Point light from the right
        const pointLight = new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff, 1.5, 100);
        pointLight.position.set(10, 10, 10);
        scene.add(pointLight);

        // Point light from the bottom
        const bottomLight = new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff, 1.5, 100);
        bottomLight.position.set(0, -10, 0); // Positioned below the model
        scene.add(bottomLight);

        // Point light from the left
        const leftLight = new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff, 1.5, 100);
        leftLight.position.set(-10, 0, 0); // Positioned to the left of the model
        scene.add(leftLight);




This is looking really good
Lets upload this draft and re-assess the following goals
    Adjust canvas height
    canvas opacity, would be cool if it was invisible...
    change initial direction of model on page load
  Photos on bottom
  background does not stretch when horizontal on mobile
